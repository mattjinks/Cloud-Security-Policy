# Cloud-Security-Policy
This project was completed on a team of four for CS-4725: Information Security Strategies and Policy at Georgia Tech

## Overview

The objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive Cloud Security Policy for a simulated large financial institution undergoing transition from on-premises to cloud infrastructure

- Drafted a detailed memo for the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) outlining the identified cloud-related threats and their potential impact on the bank’s operations and assets

- Developed a robust Cloud Security Policy aligned with NIST recommendations and U.S. financial regulations

- Drafted a memorandum justifying the new cloud security policies to senior management as a strategic investment that could prevent millions of dollars in breach costs

## Assignemnt Instructions

As businesses transition from on-premises solutions to cloud computing, many of them face new challenges in keeping their new cloud infrastructure secure. In this project, I worked as part of a team to draft a corporate Cloud Security Policy and accompanying documents that address risks in a company’s usage of cloud computing.

**Assignment Premise:** Our team reports to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at an imaginary bank, Burdell Bank. With its tens of thousands of employees, Burdell Bank manages about $400 billion in assets across several business lines in the United States. Executive leadership just announced an upcoming, company-wide initiative to replace decades-old, on-premises computing infrastructure with a modern cloud provider. To prepare for the change, the CISO has asked our team for three deliverables.

**Part 1:** In this initial memo to the CISO, we explain the key cybersecurity threats facing the bank that are especially relevant to using the cloud compared to the bank’s past practice.

**Part 2:** The CISO has asked our team to draft a Cloud Security Policy for the Burdell Bank, specifically addressing the threats from cloud computing, and mitigation techniques. The CISO wants the policy to align with NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) recommendations and comply with any relevant regulatory requirements and guidance from financial services regulators. The new policy will only cover the bank’s U.S. operations. Assume the company has in place cybersecurity policies for other topics, but not for cloud security. Our cybersecurity policy is consistent with the threats identified in Part 1 as well as the recommendations in Part 3 to the organization’s management.

**Part 3:** A Senior Vice President, Steve Cabrera, has asked our group to prepare a memorandum justifying the new policy as a positive step for the business. Senior management will use our group’s memo in determining what steps it should take to manage risks resulting from shifting to a third-party cloud provider.
